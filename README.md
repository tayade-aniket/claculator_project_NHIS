Python GUI Calculator using Tkinter

Introduction

We hope you already have a basic understanding of Python-based calculator programs and are eager to transition into creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for better presentation and reusability. Tkinter, the standard GUI toolkit for Python, will be used in this project to develop an interactive calculator application.

Project Overview

Before diving into the code, letâ€™s outline the key aspects of the calculator we will build, its functionalities, and its essential components.

Features of the GUI Application

The application will include:

Equation Display Area: A screen to show mathematical expressions and results.

Clickable Buttons: Buttons for numerical values and mathematical operations.

Core Mathematical Operations: Support for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Functionalities:

Calculate results (=).

Clear the equation display (C).

Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will:

Strengthen your understanding of Core Python.

Gain experience with the Tkinter library.

Enhance your skills in using Visual Studio Code (IDE).

Learn how to use GitHub for version control and collaboration.

Develop a functional Python application.
